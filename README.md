# GoCD Monitor

This tool will continuously monitor a GoCD server, and log statistics and other critical information to diagnose issues with GoCD.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
